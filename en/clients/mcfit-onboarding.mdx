<Note>
**Estimated Setup Time:** max. 30 minutes depending on your site complexity  
**Required Access:** Developer access to your website's codebase  
</Note>

## Phase 1: Script Integration

The first step is integrating our analytics script into your website.

<Note>
Please keep in mind that this is only an additional resource to the in-product onboarding. You'll get the script for your website in the onboarding flow.
</Note>

### Installation Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate your unique script">
  Your unique tracking script is available in your dashboard under **Settings → Installation**.
  
  It will look like this:
```html
  <script defer src="https://analytics.bchic.de/script.js" data-website-id="1234567"></script>
```
  <Warning>
  **Important:** Each domain requires its own unique `data-site` identifier. Never share this script across different domains.
  </Warning>
</Step>
<Step title="Add the script to your website">
  Insert the script in the `<head>` section of your HTML, just before the closing `</head>` tag.
  <Tabs>
  <Tab title="Standard HTML">
```html index.html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>Your Website</title>
  <!-- Other head elements -->
  
  <!-- Analytics Script - Add before closing </head> -->
  <script src="https://analytics.yourcompany.com/script.js" 
          data-site="YOUR_SITE_ID" 
          defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Your content -->
</body>
</html>
```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="React / Next.js">
```jsx _app.js or layout.js
    import Head from 'next/head';
    
    export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
      return (
        <>
          <Head>
            <script 
              src="https://analytics.yourcompany.com/script.js" 
              data-site="YOUR_SITE_ID" 
              defer 
            />
          </Head>
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        </>
      );
    }
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="WordPress">
    Add this code to your theme's `header.php` file or use a plugin like "Insert Headers and Footers":
```html header.php
    <!-- Add before wp_head() or in the <head> section -->
    <script src="https://analytics.yourcompany.com/script.js" 
            data-site="YOUR_SITE_ID" 
            defer></script>
    <?php wp_head(); ?>
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Google Tag Manager">
    1. Create a new **Custom HTML** tag in GTM
    2. Paste the script code
    3. Set trigger to **All Pages**
    4. Publish your container
```html
    <script src="https://analytics.yourcompany.com/script.js" 
            data-site="YOUR_SITE_ID" 
            defer></script>
```
  </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</Step>
<Step title="Verify installation">
  After deploying the script, verify it's working correctly, by clicking the button in the onboarding flow. Bchic Analytics will automatically check if data is available and redirect you to the dashboard. 
</Step>
</Steps>

### Script initiated successfully

This is how your dashboard will look like when the script was successfully initiated.

## Phase 2: Event Tagging

Now that the script is running, the next step is to tag specific elements on your website so the analytics platform can track user interactions like button clicks, form submissions, and custom events.

### Understanding Event Types

Our platform supports two types of event tracking:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Property-Type Events" icon="tag">
  **Simple event tracking** that only sends the event name.
Use Case: Track that a button was clicked, without additional context.

Example: Newsletter signup button, download link
</Card>

<Card title="Payload Events" icon="database">
  **Advanced tracking** that sends event name + additional non-personal data.
Use Case: Track which product was added to cart, which filter was applied.

Example: Product category, search term, filter selection
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
**Critical Privacy Requirement**
Our platform is designed to work without personal data. Never include:

Email addresses
Names or usernames
Phone numbers
IP addresses
Any personally identifiable information (PII)

Why this matters: Including personal data defeats the purpose of our privacy-first analytics and may violate data protection regulations. It also degrades the platform's ability to provide accurate, aggregated insights.

What you CAN send: Product IDs, category names, page sections, feature names, non-personal filter values, generic labels.
</Warning>

### Adding Event Attributes

Events are tracked by adding data attributes to your HTML elements. The script automatically detects these attributes and sends the data to our servers.

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose your event type">
  Decide whether you need a simple property-type event or a payload event with additional data.
Decision Guide:

Need to know IF something happened? → **Property-Type**

Need to know WHAT happened specifically? → **Payload Event**
</Step>
<Step title="Add the data attribute">
  Add the appropriate data attribute to your HTML element.
  <Tabs>
  <Tab title="Property-Type Event">
    **Syntax:** `data-bchic-event="event-name"`
```html
    <!-- Before: Untracked button -->
    <button class="cta-button">
      Download Whitepaper
    </button>
<!-- After: Tracked with property-type event -->
<button class="cta-button" 
        data-bchic-event="whitepaper-download">
  Download Whitepaper
</button>
```
    
    **What gets tracked:** Event name `whitepaper-download` is sent when clicked.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Payload Event">
    **Syntax:** `window.bchic.track" TO BE ADDED='{"key": "value"}'`
```html
    <!-- Before: Untracked product card -->
    <div class="product-card">
      <h3>Premium Plan</h3>
      <button class="add-to-cart">Add to Cart</button>
    </div>
    
    <!-- After: Tracked with payload event -->
    <div class="product-card">
      <h3>Premium Plan</h3>
      <button class="add-to-cart" 
              window.bchic.track="add-to-cart"
              TO BE ADDED='{"product": "premium-plan", "category": "subscription"}'>
        Add to Cart
      </button>
    </div>
```
**What gets tracked:** Event name `add-to-cart` plus payload data `{"product": "premium-plan", "category": "subscription"}`.

<Note>
**JSON Format Required:** The payload must be valid JSON. Use single quotes around the attribute value and double quotes inside the JSON object.
</Note>
  </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</Step>
<Step title="Test your events">
  After adding event attributes, test them to ensure they're firing correctly:
  Navigate to the Events section in Bchic Analytics and see the events getting logged. 
  
  The events should appear in real time, if they don't show up immediately, simply refresh (**Command + R** / **Ctrl + R**) the site and you should see your events.
  <Note>
  We already track the Scroll-Depth and Outbound clicks by default, so there is no more setting up for you to do here. 
  </Note>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices for Event Naming

Follow these conventions to keep your event data organized and meaningful:

<Info>
This is not available yet, but in the future it will be possible to change the naming of individual event-names, which allows your marketing teams to work with real names instead of IDs. The default will always stay the ID, but can be given a more user friendly name.
</Info>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Naming Conventions">
  **Use kebab-case for event names:**
  - ✅ `newsletter-signup`
  - ✅ `add-to-cart`
  - ✅ `video-play`
  - ❌ `Newsletter_Signup`
  - ❌ `addToCart`

Be specific but concise:

✅ pricing-cta-click
❌ click
❌ user-clicked-the-pricing-page-call-to-action-button

Use consistent terminology:

If you use signup in one place, don't use register elsewhere for the same action
</Tab>

<Tab title="Privacy Checklist">
  **Before adding any payload data, verify:**
  
  - Contains NO email addresses
  - Contains NO names or usernames
  - Contains NO phone numbers
  - Contains NO location data more specific than country/region
  - Contains NO user IDs or session IDs
  - Contains NO IP addresses
  - Contains ONLY generic, aggregatable data
  
  **Safe payload examples:**
  - Product categories, SKUs, or generic identifiers
  - Feature names or section labels
  - Non-personal filter selections
  - Content types or formats
  - Generic status indicators
</Tab>
</Tabs>
