<Note>
    **Estimated Setup Time:** max. 30 minutes depending on your site complexity
    **Required Access:** Developer access to your website's codebase
</Note>

## Phase 1: Script Integration

The first step is integrating our analytics script into your website.

<Note>
    Please keep in mind that this is only an additional resource to the in-product onboarding. You'll get the script for your website in the onboarding flow.
</Note>

### Installation Steps

<Steps>
    <Step title="Locate your unique script">
        Your unique tracking script is available in your dashboard under **Settings → Installation**.

        It will look like this:
        ```html
        <script defer src="https://analytics.bchic.de/script.js" data-website-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"></script>
        ```
        <Warning>
            **Important:** Each domain requires its own unique `data-website-id` identifier. Never share this script across different domains.
        </Warning>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the script to your website">
        Insert the script in the `<head>` section of your HTML, just before the closing `</head>` tag.
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Standard HTML">
                ```html index.html
                <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html lang="en">
                <head>
                    <meta charset="UTF-8">
                        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
                            <title>Your Website</title>
                            <!-- Other head elements -->

                            <!-- Analytics Script - Add before closing </head> -->
                            <script src="https://analytics.bchic.de/script.js"
                                    data-website-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"
                                    defer></script>
                </head>
                <body>
                <!-- Your content -->
                </body>
                </html>
                ```
            </Tab>

            <Tab title="React / Next.js">
                ```jsx _app.js or layout.js
                import Head from 'next/head';

                export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
                return (
                <>
                <Head>
                <script
                src="https://analytics.bchic.de/script.js"
                data-website-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"
                defer
                />
                </Head>
                <Component {...pageProps} />
        </>
        );
        }
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="WordPress">
        Add this code to your theme's `header.php` file or use a plugin like "Insert Headers and Footers":
        ```html header.php
        <!-- Add before wp_head() or in the <head> section -->
        <script src="https://analytics.bchic.de/script.js"
                data-website-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"
                defer></script>
        <?php wp_head(); ?>
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Google Tag Manager">
        1. Create a new **Custom HTML** tag in GTM
        2. Paste the script code
        3. Set trigger to **All Pages**
        4. Publish your container
        ```html
        <script src="https://analytics.bchic.de/script.js"
                data-website-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"
                defer></script>
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>
<Step title="Verify installation">
    After deploying the script, verify it's working correctly by clicking the button in the onboarding flow. Bchic Analytics will automatically check if data is available and redirect you to the dashboard.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Phase 1.5: URL Anonymization (Privacy Enhancement)

A critical part of a privacy-compliant setup is **URL Anonymization**. Since we must not collect personally identifiable information (PII), any URLs containing personal identifiers (e.g., a user ID, name, or order number) must be anonymized. This allows us to analyze user behavior on page types without being able to trace it back to a specific individual.

### Use Case: Anonymizing a Dynamic Profile URL

Imagine your website has a URL structure like: `https://example-shop.com/profile/12345/orders`. Here, `12345` is a unique `userId` and therefore personal data that must not be collected.

### Solution & Implementation

Add the `data-anonymize-url` attribute to your existing script tag.

<CodeGroup>
    ```html title="Before: Standard Script"
    <script
        defer
        src="https://analytics.bchic.de/script.js"
        data-website-id="YOUR_WEBSITE_ID"
    ></script>
    ```
    ```html title="After: Script with URL Anonymization"
    <script
        defer
        src="https://analytics.bchic.de/script.js"
        data-website-id="YOUR_WEBSITE_ID"
        data-anonymize-url="/profile/{userId}/*"
    ></script>
    ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info title="What gets tracked?">
    Instead of the full URL `https://example-shop.com/profile/12345/orders`, only the secure, anonymized version `/profile/{userId}/orders` is stored in your analytics.
</Info>

### How It Works & Syntax

The `data-anonymize-url` attribute uses a simple pattern language to mask dynamic parts of your URLs. Our script recognizes these patterns and replaces the corresponding segments *before* the data is sent to our servers.

- **`{placeholder}`**: Curly braces define a dynamic part of the URL that will be replaced by the placeholder name (e.g., `{userId}`). The name is for readability in your reports.
- **`*` (Wildcard)**: The asterisk acts as a "catch-all", ensuring that all subsequent URL segments are captured as they are. This is useful when the URL structure varies after the dynamic part.

### Defining Multiple Rules

If you need to anonymize several different URL structures, you can list the rules **separated by a comma** in the same attribute.

```html
<script
    defer
    src="https://analytics.bchic.de/script.js"
    data-website-id="YOUR_WEBSITE_ID"
    data-anonymize-url="/profile/{userId}/*,/orders/details/{orderId}"
></script>
```

---

## Phase 2: Event Tagging

Now that the script is running, the next step is to tag specific elements on your website so the analytics platform can track user interactions like button clicks, form submissions, and custom events.

<Info>
    **Fundamental Rules for Events**
    - **Character Limit:** Event names are limited to 50 characters.
    - **Name Required:** Event data cannot be sent without an event name.
</Info>

### Understanding Event Types
... (Rest of the event tagging section remains the same as your original) ...

### Best Practices for Event Naming

Follow these conventions to keep your event data organized and meaningful:

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Naming Conventions">
        **Use kebab-case for event names:**
        - ✅ `newsletter-signup`
        - ✅ `add-to-cart`
        - ❌ `Newsletter_Signup`

        **Be specific but concise:**
        - ✅ `pricing-cta-click`
        - ❌ `click`

        **Use consistent terminology:**
        If you use `signup` in one place, don't use `register` elsewhere for the same action.
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Privacy Checklist">
        **Before adding any event payload or tracking URLs, verify:**

        - Contains NO email addresses
        - Contains NO names or usernames
        - Contains NO phone numbers
        - Contains NO location data more specific than country/region
        - Contains NO user IDs or session IDs **in event payloads**
        - **Captured URLs** contain NO personal identifiers (user IDs, names, etc.)
        - Contains NO IP addresses (we handle this server-side)
        - Contains ONLY generic, aggregatable data

        **Safe payload examples:**
        - Product categories, SKUs, or generic identifiers
        - Feature names or section labels
        - Non-personal filter selections
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Final Step: Inviting Your Team

With your analytics tracking now fully configured, the final step is to grant access to your colleagues. This allows stakeholders, such as your marketing team, to start leveraging the data and building insights.

### How to Add Team Members

Follow these simple steps to build your team within the platform.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to Team Management">
        In the main navigation sidebar on the left, go to the **Settings** section at the bottom and click on **Team Management**.

        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/team-management-sidebar.png" alt="Navigating to the Team Management section in the sidebar" />
        </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Invite a New Member">
        On the Team Management page, you will see two tabs: `Active` and `Invited`. Click the **Invite Member** button in the top right corner to open the invitation dialog.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Choose a Role">
        Before sending the invitation, you must assign a role to the new member. Each role has a specific set of permissions designed for different levels of access.

        <CardGroup>
            <Card title="Employee" icon="user">
                **Limited Access**
                - ✅ Can view shared dashboards and reports.
                - ❌ No insight into billing or usage information.
            </Card>
            <Card title="Manager" icon="users">
                **Extended Access**
                - ✅ Can manage team members (create/edit).
                - ✅ Has full access to all team dashboards and analytics.
                - ❌ No access to global organization settings.
            </Card>
            <Card title="Admin" icon="shield-check">
                **Unrestricted Access**
                - ✅ Full access to all settings and user management.
                - ✅ Can manage data sources and integrations.
                - ✅ Complete insight into all analyses and usage data.
            </Card>
        </CardGroup>

        <Tip>
            **Our Recommendation:** For most users, like members of your marketing team, the **Employee** role is the perfect choice. It provides full access to analytics data and dashboards without granting access to system-critical menus like billing or global settings.
        </Tip>

        <Note>
            **Coming Soon:** We are working on providing the ability to create your own granular user roles for even more control.
        </Note>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Send the Invitation">
        Enter the new member's name and email address, select their role, and send the invitation. They will receive an email to join your workspace.

        Once they accept, they will appear in the `Active` tab, and you're all set!
    </Step>
</Steps>
