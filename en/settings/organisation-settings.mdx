### Website-wide Filters

Filters ensure that your statistics remain clean. You can define rules here to globally exclude internal traffic or unwanted access.

*   **Internal Access:** Exclude your own IP address or IP ranges (e.g., the office network) from tracking.
*   **Bot Filter:** Enable detection to automatically keep known crawlers and bots out of your data.
*   **Referrer Blocklist:** Define domains whose traffic should be ignored (e.g., spam referrers).

### Funnels

Funnels help you understand at which point your visitors drop off in a process. You can define funnels here, which are then available in the analysis area for evaluation.

1.  **Define Steps:** Determine which pages or events a user must pass through sequentially (e.g., `Home Page` -> `Pricing` -> `Registration`).
2.  **Optional vs. Mandatory:** Determine whether certain steps can be skipped.
3.  **Grouping:** Assign funnels to specific categories (e.g., "Marketing", "Product") to keep track of things.

### Intent Groupings

With intent groupings, you combine different URLs or behaviors into a single "intent". This enables analysis on a higher level than just individual page views.

**Examples of groupings:**

*   **Intent "Information":** Group all blog articles and help pages.
*   **Intent "Purchase Interest":** Combine pricing pages, case studies, and the "Request Demo" page.
*   **Intent "Career":** Bundle all job offers and "About Us" pages.

Once these groups are created, you can see in the dashboard how the interest distribution of your visitors develops.
