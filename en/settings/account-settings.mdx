> Account settings cover all preferences and adjustments for your personal access. They apply only to you and do not affect other team members.

## Profile & Security

In the profile area, you manage your identity and access data. Here you can ensure that your contact information is always up to date.

You have the option to adjust the following data at any time:

*   **Username:** Change how your name is displayed within the application.
*   **Email Address:** Update the email address you use for login and notifications.
*   **Password:** Change your password regularly to ensure the security of your account.

<Note>
    If you have forgotten your password, you can reset it on the login page via "Forgot Password".
</Note>

## Language Settings

Adjust the user interface to your preferred language. This setting changes the language of menus, labels, and system messages only for your account.

Currently, we support the following languages:
*   **German**
*   **English**

The changes take effect immediately once you have selected the new language.
