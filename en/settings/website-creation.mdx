> Every website you want to track with bchic Analytics must first be connected to your organization. Once linked, you'll receive an individual tracking script for each domain.

## Connect a website

Navigate to **Settings → Organization** and expand the **Linked Website URLs** section. You'll see all currently connected domains along with an input field to add new ones.

Enter the full URL of your website (e.g. `https://my-website.com`) and click the **+** icon to save it.

<Note>
    You can link as many websites as you like to a single organization. Each domain gets its own tracking script with a unique website ID.
</Note>

## Install the tracking script

Once a website is linked, you can retrieve its script. Click the **code icon** next to the desired domain in the list. A pop-up will open with a personalized installation guide.

First, select your **website platform** — supported options include WordPress, Webflow, Shopify, Squarespace, Wix, Framer, and a generic HTML option. You'll then be walked through how to embed the script on your platform.

The script itself looks something like this:

```html
<script defer src="https://analytics.bchic.de/script.js" data-website-id="YOUR-WEBSITE-ID"></script>
```

Copy the script and paste it into the `<head>` section of your website as instructed.

<Tip>
    For detailed step-by-step guides for each platform, check out our [Integrations section](/en/integration/integrationen). We recommend following the instructions there, as they account for platform-specific nuances.

## Verify tracking

After installation, you can check whether tracking is active on your website's **Overview page**. As soon as the first pageview is registered, data will appear in your dashboard.

If no data shows up after a few minutes, make sure that:

*   **the script is placed in the `<head>` section** of your page — not in the `<body>`.
*   **the website ID** in the script is correct and matches the linked domain.
*   **no ad blocker** is preventing tracking in your browser (try disabling it temporarily to test).
