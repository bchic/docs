> Our invoices are generated automatically via our billing portal (Stripe). At the beginning of every billing cycle, you receive an invoice for the booked package of the upcoming period.

## How do our invoices work?

Since our pricing model is based on data volume and not on seats, your invoice is usually very simple: You pay a fixed amount for your chosen package.

The invoice only looks more complex if you **perform an upgrade in the middle of the month** (e.g., switching from the "Starter" package to the "Business" package). In this case, our system automatically offsets the unused time of the old package against the runtime of the new package.

### Example calculation for an upgrade

Suppose you switch your package on August 16th. Your next invoice on September 1st would look like this:

| **Description**                                       | **Amount**  |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Adjustments (Aug 16 - Sep 1)**                      |             |
| Remaining time on "Business Package" after Aug 16     | €100.00     |
| Unused time on "Starter Package" after Aug 16         | -€50.00     |
| **Upcoming Month (Sep 1 - Oct 1)**                    |             |
| Business Package (Monthly)                            | €200.00     |
|                                                       |             |
| Subtotal                                              | €250.00     |
| VAT (19%)                                             | €47.50      |
| **Total**                                             | **€297.50** |

### Explanation of line items

An invoice after a switch often consists of two parts:

#### 1. The upcoming month
This is the standard part. You pay in advance for the next full month of your new package (in the example, the "Business Package" for €200).

#### 2. Adjustments for the previous month (Proration)
This section appears only if you have made changes. The system calculates billing down to the minute:

*   **Unused time (Credit):** Since you paid for the old "Starter Package" for the whole month in advance but stopped using it as of the 16th, this amount is **credited** to you (in the example -€50).
*   **Remaining time (Charge):** You have already used the services of the "Business Package" starting from August 16th. This partial amount is now **charged** to you (in the example €100).

The difference between these two amounts forms the additional payment for the upgrade in the past month.

### Summary

**Total Amount = (Pro-rated cost of new plan - Pro-rated refund of old plan) + New plan for next month**

This process ensures that you always pay exactly for the service available to you at any given time – no more, no less.
