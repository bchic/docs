> In the Organization Settings under **Subscription**, you have full control over your current plan and billing details.

We work with the Stripe Customer Portal to enable secure and easy management of your payments.

## Management via Customer Portal

Clicking the button to manage your subscription takes you directly to the secure Stripe portal.

There you can handle the following things:

*   **Invoices:** Download all past invoices as PDFs for your accounting.
*   **Payment Methods:** Update your credit card or add a new bank account if your card is expiring.
*   **Billing Information:** Change the email address for invoice delivery or your company address.
*   **Cancellation:** If you no longer need the service, you can cancel your subscription here effective at the end of the current period.

## Upgrade to Annual Billing

Do you want to switch from monthly to annual payment? You can do this directly in our application via the subscription popup.

1.  Click the button in the subscription area to change your plan or perform an upgrade.
2.  A **popup** opens where you see the available options.
3.  Select the **Annual Subscription** there.
4.  Confirm your selection.

The change takes effect immediately.

<Note>
    If you have questions about billing or encounter problems during the upgrade, feel free to contact our support.
