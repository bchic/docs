> Transparency is important to us. You pay for what you use – based on the amount of your data, not the size of your team.

You can find the latest overview and all details about the packages on our [pricing page](https://www.bchic.de/en/pricing).

## Data Point Based Pricing

**What counts as a data point?**
A data point is considered any event sent to our servers. This includes:
*   Page Views
*   Custom Events (e.g., "Button clicked", "Purchase completed")
*   Tracking signals within funnels

This model ensures that our prices grow fairly with your success and your traffic.

## Enterprise

We offer the Enterprise plan for large organizations and companies with complex requirements. **Only in this plan** are extended, individual services included:

*   **Custom Onboarding:** We support you personally with setup and integration into your tech stack.
*   **Dedicated Support:** Access to prioritized support and a dedicated contact person (Customer Success Manager).
*   **Special Provisioning:** Extended options for data security, SLAs, and contract terms.

If you need a custom quote or have questions about high data volumes, feel free to contact us directly.
