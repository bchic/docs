The filter bar is divided into three logical sections to ensure intuitive and efficient operation.

### 1. The Upper Section: Standard Filters & Controls

At the very top of the bar, you will find the basic control elements:

*   **"+ Filter" Button**: Clicking this button opens a dropdown menu where you can select standard filters such as `URL`, `Page Title`, `Referrer`, `Country`, and more. This is the starting point for creating simple, condition-based filters.

*   **Close Button (X)**: You can use this button to hide the filter bar at any time.

### 2. The Middle Section: Filter Management

This section is dedicated to managing your saved filters and user groups.

*   **Category Dropdown**: Here you can switch between different categories like `Favorites`, `User Groups`, `Conversion Goals`, and `Custom` to organize your saved filters.

*   **Save Button (Folder Icon)**: Once you have created a filter configuration in the lower section, click this icon to save it. A window will open where you can assign a name, description, and category to your configuration.

*   **Edit Button**: This button opens a modal where you can manage all your saved filters via drag-and-drop, rearrange them, or assign them to different categories.

### 3. The Lower Section: Special Filters

This is the core of the filter bar. Here you will find a list of predefined and customizable **Special Filters** that allow you to create complex user segments with just a few clicks. You can activate multiple of these filters simultaneously to further refine your analysis.
