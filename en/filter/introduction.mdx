We are excited to introduce our newest feature: the **User Groups & Filter Bar**. This powerful tool is designed to radically simplify and speed up the way you analyze and filter data. It allows you to create complex filters, save them as user groups, and reuse them at any time.

### What is the User Groups & Filter Bar?

The new bar is a central control element that allows you to segment your visitor data in real-time based on a variety of criteria. Whether you want to analyze the behavior of users from a specific campaign or identify visitors who have viewed a particular sequence of pages, this feature enables you to gain deeper insights without having to switch pages.

### How to Open the Bar

You can easily open the filter bar via the **"Filter" button**, located in the main navigation next to the date selector.

Once opened, the bar remains on the right side of the screen, even as you navigate between different analysis pages. This way, you can always keep your filters in view and adjust them at any time.
