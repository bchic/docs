The special filters are predefined, powerful segments that you can use as building blocks for your analyses. Here is an overview of each filter and its configuration options.

### Path Filters

This filter type focuses on the visitor's navigation path. It expands to show several specific options:
*   **Entry Path**: Filters by the first page a visitor viewed in their session.
*   **Exit Path**: Filters by the last page a visitor viewed before leaving your website.
*   **Containing Paths**: Shows sessions that include one or more specific pages.
*   **Path Funnel**: Defines a fixed sequence of pages and filters for visitors who have followed this path.

### Readers

This filter helps you identify engaged visitors who have spent a minimum amount of time on the site and/or viewed a minimum number of pages.
*   **Settings**: `Min. Duration (seconds)`, `Min. Pages`.

### Bouncers

Isolates visits with very low interaction (bounces). These are sessions where the visitor leaves the site quickly after only one page view.
*   **Settings**: `Max. Pages`, `Max. Duration (seconds)`.

### Non-Bouncers

The opposite of the "Bouncers" filter. It excludes all visits that are considered a bounce, thus showing all sessions with a minimum level of interaction.
*   **Settings**: The criteria (`Max. Pages`, `Max. Duration`) are used for exclusion.

### UTM/Channel Filter

An essential filter for analyzing your marketing campaigns. Filter visits by traffic channels (e.g., Paid, Organic) and/or specific UTM parameters.
*   **Settings**: `UTM Campaign`, `UTM Source`, `UTM Content`, `Channels`.

### Event

Allows filtering of sessions based on specific, custom events such as clicks on external links (`outbound-link-click`), button clicks, or other interactions.
*   **Settings**: `Event Name`, `Event Value`.
