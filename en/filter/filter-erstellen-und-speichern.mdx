The true power of the filter bar lies in the ability to create custom filter configurations, save them as reusable user groups, and organize them efficiently.

### Step 1: Add and Configure Filters

The process begins in the lower section of the bar with the **Special Filters**.

1.  **Select Filter(s)**: Choose one or more of the available special filters (e.g., `Readers`, `UTM/Channel Filter`).
2.  **Adjust Settings**: As soon as you activate a filter, a settings button (with a slider icon) appears next to it. Clicking it opens a context menu where you can define the specific conditions for that filter. Each menu includes a brief explanation of how the filter works.

    *Example: For the "Readers" filter, you can define a minimum visit duration and a minimum number of pages viewed.*

You can combine multiple filters to create highly specific segments. For example, you could combine "Readers" with a "UTM/Channel Filter" to display only engaged users from your Google Ads campaigns.

### Step 2: Save the Filter Configuration

When you are satisfied with your filter combination, you can save it as a user group for future use.

1.  Click the **Save button** (folder icon) in the middle section of the bar.
2.  The "Save Current Filter Configuration" window will open.
3.  **Fill in the fields:**
    *   **Filter Name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Engaged Users from Organic Search").
    *   **Description (Optional)**: Add a brief description that explains the purpose of the filter.
    *   **Category**: Assign the filter to a category (e.g., `Favorites`, `User Groups`) to make it easier to find later.
4.  Click **"Save Filter"**.

Your newly created filter will now appear as a clickable button under the selected category in the middle section of the bar.

### Step 3: Manage Saved Filters

Over time, you may save many filters. To keep them organized, you can manage them:

1.  Click the **"Edit" button**.
2.  The "Manage Saved Filters" modal will open.
3.  Here, you can:
    *   **Reorder filters**: Change the order of filters within a category via drag-and-drop.
    *   **Change categories**: Move a filter to a different category via drag-and-drop (e.g., from `Custom` to `Favorites`).
4.  Click **"Save Changes"** to apply your modifications.
