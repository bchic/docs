The centerpiece of the dashboard is the interactive line graph. It visualizes the trend of a selected key metric over the chosen time period and compares it to a previous period (represented by the dashed line).

**The key metric displayed in the graph is interactive.** Click the small arrow next to the metric's name (e.g., next to `Avg. Visit Duration` in the screenshot) to select a different metric for visualization.

The following metrics are available:

*   `Visitors`
*   `Pageviews`
*   `Sessions`
*   `Engagement Rate`
*   `Bounce Rate`
*   `Avg. Visit Duration`
*   `Events`: A count of all custom events. (Learn more on our page about [Understanding Events](./understanding-events)).

### The Key Metric Cards (KPIs)

Above the main graph, you'll find four essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that give you a quick, static overview of your performance.

*   **Visitors:** The number of unique users who have visited your site.
*   **Pageviews:** The total number of pages viewed by all visitors.
*   **Bounce Rate:** The percentage of visits in which only a single page was viewed.
*   **Avg. Visit Duration:** The average time a visitor spent on your website.

### Detail Widgets: Where Do Your Visitors Come From?

Below the main graph, you'll find a series of widgets that provide more detailed insights into various dimensions of your traffic: `Top Pages`, `Top Sources`, `Top 5 Countries`, `Top 5 Browsers`, and `Device Types`.

## Filtering and Customization Options

The dashboard is fully customizable. The filter bar at the top of the page and the interactive widgets offer several powerful tools to help you.

*   **Select Date Range:** Define the analysis period using predefined options (`Last 24 hours`, `Last 7 days`, etc.) or a custom range in the calendar.

*   **Granularity & Comparison:** Change the time granularity of the graph (e.g., hourly, daily) and the comparison period via the dropdown menu (defaults to `Today`).

*   **Create Segments:** Use the `+ Filter` button to create complex filters to segment data by specific criteria (e.g., `Country is Germany`).

*   **Interactive Filtering with a Click:** The fastest way to filter. Simply click on any value in one of the detail widgets (e.g., a URL in "Top Pages" or a country in "Top 5 Countries") to instantly filter the entire dashboard by that value. The filter is automatically added to the filter bar.

### FAQ

**Why does the trend column sometimes show "New"?**

"New" is displayed when there was no data for a specific source or page in the comparison period. This often happens with new marketing campaigns or newly published content.
