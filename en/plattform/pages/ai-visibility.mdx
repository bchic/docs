## Overview

AI Visibility shows you how much traffic reaches your website from AI platforms like ChatGPT or Perplexity. You can see which platforms reference you most often, which keywords they use, and which pages on your website benefit most from AI traffic.

As AI assistants are increasingly used as search engines, this traffic channel is becoming more relevant for many websites – especially for information-rich content like blogs, documentation, or comparison pages.

---

## AI Visibility Ranking

The ranking shows all AI platforms sorted by click volume. For each platform you see the absolute number of sessions and its percentage share of total AI traffic.

---

## AI Traffic Share

The donut chart shows the **AI share of your total sessions**. This gives you a quick sense of how significant AI is as a traffic channel compared to other sources like organic search or direct.

> An AI share above 10% is currently unusually high for most websites and indicates a strong presence in AI responses – especially if your content is factual and informational.

---

## AI Platforms

The widget on the right visualizes traffic from individual platforms as a bar chart. In the top right you can switch between two views:

- **Bar chart** — comparison of platforms by absolute volume
- **Line chart** — traffic over time per AI platform

The line chart is particularly useful for seeing at which times of day AI traffic arrives and whether there are trends or drops.

---

## Keyword Frequency

The word cloud shows the most common keywords through which AI platforms send users to your website. Font size corresponds to frequency — larger keywords appear more often in AI responses.

The colored dots in the top right filter by frequency threshold:
- **835+** — very frequently referenced keywords
- **420+** — medium-frequency keywords
- **5+** — all keywords with 5 or more mentions

> Keywords in the word cloud come from referrer data passed by AI platforms. Not all platforms share this data completely – for some sessions the keyword context may be missing.

---

## Top URLs

The list on the right shows which pages on your website receive the most AI traffic. Grouped pages (e.g. `Blog (10)`) can be expanded to see the individual URLs.

Use the **search** in the top right to filter for specific URLs.

## Common Analyses

**Which content performs best with AI?**
Look at the Top URLs and compare them to your most visited organic pages. Often it's different content that performs well with AI – typically in-depth, factual articles rather than landing pages.

**Which AI platform sends the most valuable traffic?**
Combine AI Visibility with [User Groups](/en/intent/usergroups) and filter by AI as referrer to see whether ChatGPT or Perplexity users tend to be transactional or informational.

**Tracking AI traffic over time**
Use the line chart to see whether your AI traffic is growing. A steady increase is a signal that your content is being referenced more and more in AI responses.
