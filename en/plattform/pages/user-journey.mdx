## Overview

Path Analysis visualizes the most common navigation routes of your visitors as a Sankey diagram. Each column represents one interaction step – from the entry page to several clicks deep into the session. The connecting lines between columns show how visitors flow from one page to the next.

At a glance you can see: where users enter, which paths lead to conversion, and where sessions drop off.

## Reading the Diagram

Each box in a column represents a page and shows three metrics:

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Number top right** | Number of sessions that reached this page at this step |
| **Clock icon** | Average time spent on this page |
| **Arrow icon** | Bounce rate for this page |

Above each column you'll see the total session count for that step and the percentage loss compared to the previous step. A loss of **52.7%** between step 1 and step 2 means more than half of all visitors ended their session after the first step.

> A **Loop** label on a page means visitors returned to it multiple times within the same session – a signal of either disorientation or active re-engagement with important content.

## Controls & Views

![Path Analysis Controls](../../../images/journeys/journeys-controls.jpeg)

The toolbar in the top right gives you four levers for your analysis:

**View Mode**

Switch between three views:
- **Overview** — All paths in the standard display
- **Losses** — Highlights pages with high drop-off rates (shown in orange)
- **Loops** — Shows only pages that users return to multiple times (shown in purple)

**Analysis Depth**

Choose between 3 and 7 steps. More steps reveal longer sessions but can reduce clarity. 5 steps is a good starting point for most websites.

**Number of Paths**

Control how many pages are shown per column: 100, 250, 500, or 1,000 paths. Less common paths are grouped into a **"X more pages..."** summary by default.

**Path Configuration**

Define a specific start and end point for the analysis:
- **Start point** — e.g. `/pricing` to see only paths that begin on the pricing page
- **Target page** — e.g. `/checkout` to work backwards and see which routes lead to checkout

## Expanding Grouped Pages

When a column contains many low-traffic pages, they are combined into a **"X more pages..."** box. Click **Details** to expand the full list and see all grouped URLs with their session counts.

Individual URLs can be unpinned directly from the group – they'll then appear as their own box in the diagram.

## Common Analyses

**Finding drop-off points**
A high loss between two steps shows where sessions end. Is the transition unclear? Is a call-to-action missing? Combine the Losses view with a filter to directly address the affected pages.

**Reconstructing conversion paths**
Set your checkout or thank-you page as the target in Path Configuration. The diagram will show you in reverse which routes users actually take to convert.

**Understanding loop behavior**
Loops on navigation pages (e.g. `/`) are a warning sign – users aren't finding what they're looking for. Loops on content pages can be positive, indicating high relevance.
