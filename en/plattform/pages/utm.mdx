![UTM Campaigns Overview](../../../images/utm/utm-overview.jpeg)

## Overview

UTM Campaigns let you precisely measure the success of your external marketing efforts. Create trackable links for newsletters, social media posts, or ads and see exactly how many clicks and sessions each campaign generates – broken down by source, medium, and campaign name.

> Your system automatically captures all incoming links with UTM parameters. The link builder additionally ensures consistent and error-free parameters.

## The Dashboard

### Source Cards

At the top you'll see one card per traffic source (e.g. LinkedIn, Google, Perplexity). Each card shows:

- **Total clicks** from this source
- **Top campaign** — the most successful individual campaign from this source
- **Marked UTM links** — number of manually created links for this source

Click **Show all X sources** to expand the full list.

### Top Campaigns

Lists all campaigns sorted by clicks. The colored dots correspond directly to the lines in the Campaign Visualization chart on the right.

### Campaign Visualization

The interactive chart shows the click volume of your top campaigns over time. In the top right you can toggle between **Clicks** and **Sessions**. Use **Show top campaigns** to control how many campaigns are displayed simultaneously in the chart.

## Filter Bar

The toolbar at the top gives you three controls:

- **Time range** — predefined options (24h, 7d, 30d, 90d) or a custom date range
- **Campaign type** — filter between `All`, `Paid` and `Organic` to compare different marketing tactics
- **+ Create new UTM link** — opens the link builder

## Creating a UTM Link

Click **+ Create new UTM link** in the toolbar. Fill in the following fields:

**Required fields:**

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `utm_source` | Where is the traffic coming from? | `linkedin`, `google` |
| `utm_medium` | How is the traffic arriving? | `cpc`, `email`, `social` |
| `utm_campaign` | Which campaign is it? | `enterprise_leadgen` |

> Think of UTM parameters like an address: **Source** is the city (where from), **Medium** is the street (how), **Campaign** is the reason for the visit (why).

The generated link is shown to you in real time. Copy it with one click and use it in your marketing materials – every click is automatically captured and attributed to the correct campaign.

## FAQ

**Why do I see "Unnamed Campaign" in the dashboard?**
This happens when an incoming link contains `utm_source` or `utm_medium` but `utm_campaign` is missing or empty. Make sure all three parameters are set.

**Do I have to create every link with this tool?**
No. UTM parameters in incoming links are automatically detected and captured. The link builder helps you maintain consistent naming – for example always using `linkedin` instead of sometimes `LinkedIn` or `linked-in`.
