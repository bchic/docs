### Filter Bar
Just like on other pages, you can filter the data by `Date Range` and use `Advanced Filters` to narrow your analysisâ€”for example, to see only the clicks originating from a specific page on your site.

### List of Outbound Link Clicks
The core component of this page is a simple yet insightful list. It contains two columns:

*   **URL:** The exact external URL the user clicked on.
*   **Count:** The total number of clicks on this specific URL within the selected date range.

By default, the list is sorted in descending order by the number of clicks, so the most popular external links always appear at the top.
