### Top Events
This widget lists all tracked event types, sorted by their total frequency (`Count`). This gives you an at-a-glance view of the most common interactions.

*   **Scroll Depth X%**: Counts how often users have scrolled down a certain percentage of a page.
*   **Outbound Link Click**: Counts every click on a link that points to an external domain.

### Event Visualization
The main graph visualizes the occurrence of top events over time. Each line represents an event.

*   **Interactivity:** Click on an event in the legend below the graph to toggle its line on or off. This allows you to focus on the interactions most relevant to you.
*   **Pageviews:** The `Pageviews` button toggles an additional line that displays total pageviews for the same period, allowing you to see events in relation to overall traffic.

### Page Performance Metrics
This table breaks down the average scroll depth for individual pages, showing you on which URLs your content is most engaging. The percentages are broken down by device type to identify differences in user behavior on `Desktop`, `Tablet`, and `Mobile`.

> **Note:** By default, visits lasting less than one second are excluded here to improve data quality and prevent metrics from being skewed by bounces.

### Related Events & Detailed Analysis
We offer dedicated analysis pages for our standard events. Use this widget for a quick jump into a more detailed view:

*   **[Scroll Depth (0-100%)](./scroll-depth):** Opens the detailed scroll depth analysis with a page preview and user retention chart.
*   **[Outbound Link Click](./outbound-link):** Takes you to a list of all external links your users have clicked on.

You can also use the `+ More Events` button to select your custom events for detailed analysis.
