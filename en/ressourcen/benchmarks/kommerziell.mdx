## Benchmarks for Commercial Sites (Stores, SaaS, Lead-Gen)

A commercial website is successful when it persuades visitors to take a desired action: buy a product, sign up, or leave their contact details. Every metric should be viewed in light of this goalâ€”the conversion.

<Note>
  **Bounce Rate is Critical Here!**
  Unlike a blog, a bounce on a commercial site almost always means a lost customer or lead. Optimizing this metric is therefore a high priority.

### Bounce Rate

| Value                | Interpretation                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **> 60%**            | **Alarming:** Your site is losing the majority of potential customers immediately. Urgent action is needed.        |
| **40% - 60%**        | **Needs Improvement:** A common, but not ideal, range. Analyze your entry pages.                                 |
| **< 40%**            | **Good to Excellent:** Your site is relevant and encourages visitors to proceed.                                   |

### Conversion Rate (measured as an event)

This is the most important metric. It is highly dependent on industry and price point, but there are general guidelines.

| Value                | Interpretation                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **< 1%**             | **Needs Improvement:** There are significant hurdles in the purchase or sign-up process.                           |
| **1% - 3%**          | **Average:** A typical range for many e-commerce stores.                                                         |
| **> 3%**             | **Good to Excellent:** Your offer and user experience are very compelling.                                       |

### User Flows (User Journeys)

There are no hard numbers here, but rather patterns to watch out for:

*   **Good Path:** `Homepage -> Category -> Product Page -> Cart -> Checkout` (few, logical steps).
*   **Bad Path:** `Product Page -> Homepage -> Search -> Product Page`. This suggests confusion or missing information.
*   **Watch for drop-offs:** In the [User Flow graph](/platform/user-journeys), analyze at which step most users exit. Is it the shipping cost page? The forced registration?

### What to do if your metrics are off?

*   **High Bounce Rate?**
    *   **Clear Value Proposition:** Is it clear within 3 seconds what you offer and why it's great?
    *   **Trust Signals:** Display customer reviews, security seals, and well-known payment providers.
*   **Low Conversion Rate?**
    *   **Simplify forms:** Only ask for the most essential information.
    *   **Call-to-Action (CTA):** Is your 'Buy' or 'Sign Up' button clearly visible and understandable?
    *   **Mobile Optimization:** Over 50
