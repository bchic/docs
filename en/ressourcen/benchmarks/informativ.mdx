## Benchmarks for Informational Sites (Blogs, Magazines, News)

An informational website is successful when it provides visitors with the information they are looking for quickly and clearly. The goal isn't necessarily a sale, but rather reader satisfaction and engagement.

The following benchmarks will help you evaluate the performance of your informational site.

<Note>
  **The context of bounce rate is crucial here!**
  A high bounce rate is not always a bad sign for informational sites. If a user finds an answer on your page via Google, reads it, and leaves, your page was successfulâ€”even if it technically counts as a "bounce."

### Bounce Rate

| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **> 80%**            | **Needs Improvement:** Likely a problem. Visitors aren't finding what they expect, or the loading time is too high. |
| **60% - 80%**        | **Normal:** A common range for blogs and news sites. Analyze the pages with the highest rates.                     |

### Avg. Session Duration

| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **< 1 Minute**       | **Needs Improvement:** Visitors are only skimming your page and see no reason to stay.                             |
| **1 - 3 Minutes**    | **Good:** A solid value indicating that the content is being read.                                               |
| **> 3 Minutes**      | **Excellent:** Your articles are captivating and hold the readers' attention.                                    |

### What to do if your metrics are off?

*   **High Bounce Rate / Low Session Duration?**
    *   **Improve readability:** Use shorter paragraphs, subheadings, and images.
    *   **Strong introduction:** The first few sentences must captivate the reader and assure them they are in the right place.
    *   **Internal linking:** Offer links to related topics at the end of the article.
