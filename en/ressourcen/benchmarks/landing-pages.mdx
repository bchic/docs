## Benchmarks for Landing Pages

A landing page has only **one single goal**: to persuade the visitor to take a single, specific action (e.g., download, sign up, purchase). It is highly focused and free of distractions like a main navigation menu.

The performance expectations here are different—and often higher—than for a regular website.

<Note>
  **Conversion Rate is King Here!**
  All other metrics, like session duration or bounce rate, are secondary. If the conversion occurs, the landing page has fulfilled its purpose, even if the user bounces immediately afterward.

### Conversion Rate (measured as an event)

This is the single most important metric for a landing page.

| Value                | Interpretation                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **< 2%**             | **Needs Improvement:** The offer and the page are not aligned.                                                     |
| **2% - 5%**          | **Solid:** A good average for many industries.                                                                   |
| **5% - 10%**         | **Very Good:** Your page and offer are highly compelling.                                                          |
| **> 10%**            | **Excellent / Unicorn Status:** You have an outstandingly high-performing landing page.                            |

### Bounce Rate

This metric must be interpreted with care.

*   **Scenario A: High Bounce Rate & High Conversion Rate**
    This is **perfect**. The user arrived, took the action (e.g., entered their email), and then left the page. Goal achieved.

*   **Scenario B: High Bounce Rate & Low Conversion Rate**
    This is a **clear alarm signal**. Visitors are arriving (e.g., from an ad) and leaving immediately because their expectations are not being met.

**Problem Indicator:** A bounce rate of **> 80%** combined with a conversion rate of **< 1%** points to a fundamental problem.

### Avg. Session Duration

This is often very short for landing pages, which is not necessarily a bad thing.

*   **Under 30 seconds:** Completely normal if the page is clear and the action is simple.
*   **Over 1 minute:** Can indicate that visitors are undecided, are looking for more information, or that the copy is too long and complex.

### What to do if your metrics are off?

*   **Low Conversion Rate?**
    *   **Message Matching:** Does the headline of your ad exactly match the headline on your landing page?
    *   **One Call-to-Action (CTA):** Remove all links and buttons that do not lead to the main goal. No links to the blog, "About Us," or social media.
    *   **Above the Fold:** Are the most important message and the CTA button visible without scrolling?
    *   **Social Proof:** Add testimonials, logos of well-known clients, or case studies.
