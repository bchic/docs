> To not just count visitors, but to understand them, we need to know *why* they visit specific pages. Here you assign your URLs to specific intents.

You can find this tool under **Websites > User Groups > Sitemap**.

## Step 1: Choose the Strategy

When you start the classification, we first index all your pages. Afterward, you have to make an important decision: What do you want to focus on during manual sorting?

There are two primary categories available to you:
1.  **Informational Interest:** Blogs, glossaries, "About Us" pages. The user wants knowledge.
2.  **Commercial Interest:** Product pages, pricing, services. The user wants to buy or book.

<Tip>
    **Pro Tip: Choose the path of least resistance.**

    The system works on the principle of exclusion. Everything you do **not** mark will automatically be assigned to the other category.

    *   Do you have a huge online shop (many products) with a small blog? Choose **Setup Informational Interest**. You then only have to mark the few blog pages.
    *   Do you have a large content site with only a few products? Choose **Setup Commercial Interest**.

    Always choose the category that includes **fewer** pages on your website. This saves you a lot of time.

## Step 2: Assign Pages (The Tree View)

After choosing your strategy, you enter the visual editor. Here you see a list of your pages and folders on the left and a visual tree structure (sitemap) on the right.

**How the assignment works:**

*   **Individual Pages:** Simply click on a page in the list or a point on the graph to assign it to the selected category (e.g., "Informational"). Marked pages are highlighted in color (green).
*   **Entire Folders (Bulk Action):** You don't have to click every page individually. If you want to mark an entire folder (e.g., `/blog/`):
*   Hold `CTRL` (or `CMD`) and click on the node in the graph.
*   Use `SHIFT` + `Click` to include or exclude subfolders (child nodes).

Use the **search bar** on the left side to quickly find specific paths if your site is very extensive.

## Step 3: Filter out "Noise"

Not every page on your website has a real commercial or informational intent. Some pages are purely functional or legally necessary.

In the next step, you can mark these pages as **"Noise"** so they don't skew your statistics.

Typical candidates for exclusion are:
*   Imprint & Privacy Policy
*   Terms & Conditions
*   Login pages
*   Cart checkouts (unless they should count as conversions)

## Completion & Adjustment

At the end, you get an overview of your classification. Once you confirm, the system begins analyzing user behavior based on these intent groups.

<Note>
    Don't worry, nothing is set in stone. You can return to the sitemap settings at any time to assign new pages or change categories if your website structure changes.
