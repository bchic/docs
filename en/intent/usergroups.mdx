> User groups help you understand how visitors who were successful behave compared to those who dropped off.

When you open the **Websites > User Groups** area for the first time, you will be greeted by a popup asking for a "Conversion Goal". For the system to work, we must first define this goal.

## Step 1: What is a Conversion Goal?

A conversion goal is the **ultimate moment of success** on your website. This is usually an event that is "irreversible" and represents the conclusion of a journey.

Typical examples:
*   A completed purchase (`Event: Purchase`)
*   A successful registration (`URL: /thank-you-signup`)
*   Booking an appointment

## Step 2: Create the Goal

Since we haven't defined this goal yet, we need to create it using the filter function.

1.  **Open filter bar:** Click the `Filter` button in the top right to open the menu.
2.  **Select criteria:** Now select exactly the conditions that describe your goal (e.g., *Event is "Purchase"* or *Page path is "/order-thank-you"*).
3.  **Save:** Once you have set the filter, click on the **floppy disk icon** (Save) at the bottom right of the filter bar.

## Step 3: Categorize as Conversion Goal

This is the most important step. In the save dialog, you need to give the filter a name and choose the correct category.

*   **Filter Name:** Enter a unique name (e.g., "Purchase Completed").
*   **Category:** In the dropdown menu, be sure to select the option `Conversion Goal` (or `Conversion Ziel`). Only then will this filter appear later in the User Groups popup.

Click on **Save Filter**.

## Step 4: Generate Groups

Now return to the **User Groups** page.

1.  In the popup (or if you click on "Create User Intent Filter"), you can now select your newly created filter under **Conversion Goal**.
2.  Click on **Generate Groups**.

The system will now retroactively analyze your visitor data and divide them into groups (e.g., users who purchased vs. users who only browsed). This subsequently allows you to make detailed comparisons between successful and unsuccessful visitors.
