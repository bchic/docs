> Transparency is crucial. In this area, you can track at any time how many data points your organization has consumed and how close you are to your package limit.

You can find this overview in the **Settings** under the menu item **Usage**.

## Your Usage at a Glance

The heart of this page is the interactive graph **"Data Points over Time"**. It helps you identify trends in your traffic and estimate in good time whether your current package is still sufficient.

### How to Read the Graph

*   **The Blue Trend:** The blue area visualizes the **total number of processed data points**. Page views and events are summed up here. A steep rise (as seen in the screenshot) indicates strong growth or a successful campaign.
*   **The Red Dashed Line (Limit):** This line at the bottom (or higher up depending on the package) marks the **upper limit of your currently booked package**.
*   Is your blue graph **below** the red line? Everything is perfect, you are within your budget.
*   Does the blue graph intersect or exceed the red line? Then you have exceeded your included volume.

### Analyzing Time Periods

By default, the graph shows the current trend.

*   **Select End Date:** At the top right of the widget, you will find a date field (in the image `December 10, 2025`). Click on it to adjust the observation period. This is particularly helpful for analyzing past months or comparing seasonal peaks (e.g., holiday season) with the current month.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What happens if I exceed the limit?**
If the blue curve permanently exceeds the red limit line, we recommend upgrading to the next higher package to ensure that all your data continues to be processed without gaps. You can perform the upgrade directly via the subscription popup.

**Why does my usage fluctuate so much?**
Data points correlate directly with visitors and actions on your website. Marketing campaigns, viral blog posts, or seasonal effects are reflected here immediately.
