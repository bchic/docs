Not every interaction needs to be tediously set up manually. Our tracking script is intelligent enough to automatically detect important standard metrics and send them as events to your dashboard.

Currently, the following standard events are active "out-of-the-box":

## Outbound Links

bchic automatically detects when a visitor clicks on a link that leaves your website (e.g., to social media profiles, partners, or external sources).

*   **Event Name:** `Outbound Link: Click`
*   **Payload:** The URL of the target page.

**Why is this important?**
You instantly see which of your partnerships or social media channels receive the most traffic from your site, without having to manually tag every single external link.

## Scroll Depth

Visitors land on your page – but do they actually read your content? Scroll tracking measures what percentage of a page was actually seen by the user.

The script fires events once certain markers are reached (e.g., when the user reaches the end of an article).

*   **Benefit:** Identify blog articles that are clicked often but not read to the end (high bounce rate, low scroll depth).

## Coming Soon (Roadmap)

We are constantly expanding automatic capture. The following metrics will be available automatically soon:

    <Card title="Dead Clicks" icon="skull">
        **Detect "Rage Clicks".**
        We detect when users frustratedly click multiple times on elements that don't react (e.g., broken buttons or images that look like links). This helps you find UX issues in seconds.

    <Card title="Performance (Web Vitals)" icon="gauge-high">
        **Understand load times.**
        We automatically measure **Core Web Vitals** (LCP, CLS, FID/INP). This allows you to see not just how many visitors you have, but also whether your site loads fast enough to keep them.
