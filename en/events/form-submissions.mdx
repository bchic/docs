Forms are often the most important conversion point of a website. Whether newsletter, contact request, or lead gen – you want to know how often they are filled out.

## Method 1: The "Thank You Page" (Recommended)

The most reliable way to measure a **successful** submission is redirection to a separate confirmation page (e.g., `/thank-you` or `/success`).

**Why is this better?**
- You only measure *real* submissions (no validation errors).
- There are no technical issues with page reloading.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Setup Redirection">
        Configure your form plugin or CMS so that the user is redirected to `/thank-you` after submission.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Trigger Event">
        Insert a small script on this thank you page that fires upon loading.

        ```html
        <script>
            // Waits until page is loaded
            window.addEventListener('load', function() {
            if (window.bchic) {
            bchic.track('track', 'form_submit_success', { form_id: 'contact_page' });
        }
        });
        </script>
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Method 2: HTML Attributes (The Fast Way)

If you don't have a thank you page or the form is sent via AJAX (without reloading), you can tag the submit element directly.

Simply add the `data-bchic-event` attribute to your **submit button**.

```html
<form action="/submit" method="POST">
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your Email" />

  <!-- Tracking sits on the button -->
  <button type="submit"
          data-bchic-event="newsletter_signup_click">
    Sign Up
  </button>
</form>
```

<Warning>
    **Attention:** This tracks the **click** on the button. It also counts if the user clicks the button but the form is not sent due to missing data (e.g., invalid email).
</Warning>

## Method 3: JavaScript (Precise Control)

For full control (e.g., only track if validation was successful), use JavaScript.

```javascript
const form = document.getElementById('my-form');

form.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
  // 1. Check validation here optionally

  // 2. Send tracking
  bchic.track('track', 'contact_form_submit', {
      category: 'sales_request' // Example Payload
  });

  // Form is processed normally afterwards
});
```

## Form Data in Payload? (Privacy!)

You might want to know **what** was selected in the form (e.g., the subject of the request). This is possible, but you must be extremely careful.

<CodeGroup>
    ```javascript ✅ Allowed (Generic)
    // Track selection in a dropdown
    const subject = document.getElementById('subject_select').value;

    bchic.track('track', 'form_submit', {
    topic: subject // e.g. "Support" or "Sales"
});
    ```

    ```javascript ❌ Forbidden (PII)
    // NEVER track personal data!
    const email = document.getElementById('email_field').value;

    bchic.track('track', 'form_submit', {
    user_email: email // This violates GDPR
});
    ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
    **Rule:** Never send data that could identify a user (email, name, phone, address). Limit yourself to generic selection fields (category, department, product interest).
