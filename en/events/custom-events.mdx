After the basic script is running, the next step is "tagging". This allows you to capture user interactions like button clicks, form submissions, or purchases that cannot be tracked automatically.

<Info>
    **Basic Rules**
    - **Character Limit:** Event names are limited to 50 characters.
    - **Name Required:** Events cannot be sent without a name.
</Info>

## Understand Event Types

We distinguish between two types of events:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
    <Card title="Property-Type Events" icon="tag">
        **Simple Tracking.** Sends only the name of the action.

        *Example:* "Button clicked", "Menu opened".
    </Card>

    <Card title="Payload Events" icon="database">
        **Advanced Tracking.** Sends the name plus additional data (context).

        *Example:* "Product added to cart" (incl. product name, price, category).
    </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
    **Critical Privacy Notice**
    bchic is designed to work completely without personally identifiable information (PII).

    **Never** use the following data in your events:
    - Email addresses
    - Names or usernames
    - Phone numbers
    - IP addresses
    - User IDs (in plain text)

    **Allowed are:** Product IDs, categories, prices, generic status messages (e.g., "Plan: Pro").
</Warning>

## Method 1: HTML Attributes (No-Code)

This is the easiest method. You simply add attributes to your HTML elements – our script handles the rest automatically.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Choose Event Type">
        Decide if you just want to know **IF** something happened (Property), or **WHAT** exactly happened (Payload).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add Attributes">
        Add the `data-bchic-event` attribute to the HTML element.

        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Simple Event">
                **Syntax:** `data-bchic-event="NAME"`

                ```html
                <!-- Before -->
                <button class="btn">Download</button>

                <!-- After -->
                <button class="btn" data-bchic-event="whitepaper-download">
                    Download
                </button>
                ```
            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Event with Data (Payload)">
                **Syntax:**
                - Name: `data-bchic-event="NAME"`
                - Data: `data-bchic-event-{KEY}="{VALUE}"`

                ```html
                <button class="add-to-cart"
                        data-bchic-event="add-to-cart"
                        data-bchic-event-product="premium-plan"
                        data-bchic-event-price="29.99">
                    Add to Cart
                </button>
                ```

                **Result:** Sends the event `add-to-cart` with the data `{ product: 'premium-plan', price: '29.99' }`.

                <Note>
                    **Note:** Data via HTML attributes is always transmitted as **text (string)**. For real numbers or booleans, use Method 2 (JavaScript).
                </Note>
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Test">
        Click on the element and check your bchic Dashboard. The event should appear immediately. If not, reload the dashboard once.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Method 2: JavaScript (For Developers)

For full flexibility or dynamic applications, use the function call `bchic()`. This method is ideal if you have data from an API or data types (numbers, booleans) are important.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Simple">
        ```javascript
        const button = document.getElementById('signup-button');

        button.addEventListener('click', () => {
        // Sends only the name
        bchic.track('track', 'signup_click');
    });
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="With Payload">
        ```javascript
        const button = document.querySelector('.add-to-cart');

        button.addEventListener('click', () => {
        bchic.track('track', 'add-to-cart', {
            product: 'premium-plan',
            price: 99.99,     // Saved as number
            currency: 'EUR',  // Important for revenue statistics
            is_featured: true // Saved as boolean
        });
    });
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

To keep your data clean, we recommend the following conventions:

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Naming">
        **Use Kebab-Case:**
        - ✅ `newsletter-signup`
        - ❌ `Newsletter Signup`

        **Be Specific:**
        - ✅ `pricing-cta-click`
        - ❌ `click`

        **Consistency:**
        Do not use `signup` on Page A and `register` on Page B for the same action.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Privacy Checklist">
        Before implementing an event, ask yourself the following questions:

        1. Is an email address in the payload? ❌ (Forbidden)
        2. Is a User ID included? ❌ (Only allowed hashed or as internal ID)
        3. Is the data general enough? ✅ (e.g., product category instead of username)
    </Accordion>
