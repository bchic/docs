## <span className="date-badge">December 2025</span> User Intent, Smart Paths & UX Upgrades

Our final major update of the year brings deep insights into user intent and powerful new analysis tools.

### Added: Sitemap Indexing & User Intent (Business Plan)
Understand not just *what* users do, but *why* they do it. With our new Sitemap integration, you can import your site structure and classify areas (e.g., Informational vs. Commercial). Alternatively, manually group visited paths to visually recognize visitor interests at a glance.


### New: Power Feature "Paths"

       alt="Path in bchic Analytics Dashboard"
/>

Path analysis has been completely overhauled. Instead of simple flows, you now see detailed metrics for every step:
- **Dwell Time:** How long do users stay on a specific path segment?
- **Loss & Loop Detection:** Instantly identify where users drop off ("Loss") or go in circles ("Loop"), signaling potential confusion.


### Added: Advanced Filtering & Grouping

       className="rounded-lg"
       src="/videos/grouping.mp4"
       alt="Grouping in bchic Analytics Dashboard"
/>

The filter bar has become much more powerful:
- **Global Device Filters:** Quickly filter your entire view by Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet.
- **URL Grouping:** Group entire path classes (e.g., `/blog/*` or `/products/*`) to keep your analysis organized. Now supports Regex for maximum flexibility.


### Improved: UTM Campaign Visualization
Small detail, big impact: The UTM overview now automatically displays logos for known platforms (Instagram, Meta, ChatGPT, etc.), allowing you to identify traffic sources faster visually.
