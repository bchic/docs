## <span className="date-badge">February 2026</span> Funnel Analysis, Payloads & 404 Tracking

The first update of the year expands the platform with essential conversion tools and deeper insights into technical events.

### New: Funnel Analysis

Understand where you lose users. With the new Funnel Analysis, you can define custom routes (e.g., Landing Page -> Pricing -> Checkout) and see at a glance:
- **Conversion Rates:** What percentage of users reach the next step?
- **Drop-off Points:** At which point do most users abandon the process?

### Added: Detailed Event Payloads
Your custom events now offer full transparency. You can view attached payload data (JSON/metadata) directly in the event overview ("Event Payload"). This allows for a granular analysis of specific user actions without detours.

### New: Automatic 404 Tracking
Find out when and where users land on error pages. Integration is incredibly simple:
Mark any element on your 404 page with the attribute `data-bchic-error="404"`. The system detects this automatically and lists the errors clearly in your events.

### Improved: Outbound Links Visualization
The display of "Outbound Links" has been completely redesigned. New visualizations provide a faster overview of click volumes and the distribution of external destinations.

## <span className="date-badge">December 2025</span> User Intent, Smart Paths & UX Upgrades

Our final major update of the year brings deep insights into user intent and powerful new analysis tools.

### Added: Sitemap Indexing & User Intent (Business Plan)
Understand not just *what* users do, but *why* they do it. With our new Sitemap integration, you can import your site structure and classify areas (e.g., Informational vs. Commercial). Alternatively, manually group visited paths to visually recognize visitor interests at a glance.


### New: Power Feature "Paths"

       alt="Path in bchic Analytics Dashboard"
/>

Path analysis has been completely overhauled. Instead of simple flows, you now see detailed metrics for every step:
- **Dwell Time:** How long do users stay on a specific path segment?
- **Loss & Loop Detection:** Instantly identify where users drop off ("Loss") or go in circles ("Loop"), signaling potential confusion.


### Added: Advanced Filtering & Grouping

       className="rounded-lg"
       src="/videos/grouping.mp4"
       alt="Grouping in bchic Analytics Dashboard"
/>

The filter bar has become much more powerful:
- **Global Device Filters:** Quickly filter your entire view by Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet.
- **URL Grouping:** Group entire path classes (e.g., `/blog/*` or `/products/*`) to keep your analysis organized. Now supports Regex for maximum flexibility.


### Improved: UTM Campaign Visualization
Small detail, big impact: The UTM overview now automatically displays logos for known platforms (Instagram, Meta, ChatGPT, etc.), allowing you to identify traffic sources faster visually.
