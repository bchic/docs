Framer websites work as "Single Page Applications" (SPA). This means that the page does not reload completely when navigating. However, the bchic integration detects these page changes automatically.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Copy Tracking Script">
        Copy your tracking script from the bchic Dashboard.

        If you have just created your site, the code is displayed directly. Alternatively, you can find it at any time in the **Settings** under your website.

        The code looks something like this (make sure your **Data-Website-ID** is included):

        ```html
        <script defer src="https://analytics.bchic.de/script.js" data-website-id="YOUR-ID-HERE"></script>
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Paste into Framer">
        Now go to your Framer project:

        1. Click on the **gear icon** (Settings) or on the name of your project in the top bar.
        2. Select **General** under "Site Settings" in the left menu.
        3. Scroll down to the **Custom Code** section.
        4. Find the text field **Start of &lt;head&gt; tag**.

        Paste your copied code into this field.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Publish">
        To make the code active, you must push your changes live:

        1. Click the blue **Publish** button in the top right.
        2. Wait briefly until the site has updated.

        Now visit your live website. Since bchic automatically supports SPAs, you don't need to make any further settings. Your visits should appear immediately in the dashboard.
    </Step>
