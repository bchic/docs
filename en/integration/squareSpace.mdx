Integration into Squarespace is very simple thanks to "Code Injection".

<Steps>
    <Step title="Copy Tracking Script">
        Copy your tracking script from the bchic Dashboard (Settings -> Website).

        It looks something like this:

        ```html
        <script defer src="https://analytics.bchic.de/script.js" data-website-id="YOUR-ID-HERE"></script>
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Open Website Tools">
        Log in to your Squarespace account.

        1. Go to **Website** in the main menu.
        2. Scroll all the way down to **Website Tools** (or under "Utilities").
        3. Click on **Code Injection**.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Paste Code">
        Paste your bchic script into the top text field **Header**.

        Click **Save** in the top left. From now on, all visitors to your website will be tracked.
    </Step>

</Steps>

## E-Commerce Tracking (Capture Purchases)

If you use the Squarespace Online Store, you can automatically track purchases and revenue. The code must be inserted on the "Order Confirmation Page".

1. Go back to **Website Tools** -> **Code Injection**.
2. Scroll down to the **Order Status Page** field.
3. Paste the following code there:

 ```html
 <script>
   window.addEventListener('load', function() {
     if(window.bchic) {
       // {orderGrandTotalCents} is a Squarespace variable
       bchic('track', 'purchase', {
         value: {orderGrandTotalCents},
         currency: 'EUR' // Optional, if your currency is always Euro
       });
     }
   });
 </script>
    ```

This sends a `purchase` event with the revenue in cents to your dashboard for every successful purchase.

## Track Forms

By default, Squarespace forms do not send events. The most reliable way to measure form submissions is redirection to a "Thank You Page".

1. **Create a Thank You Page:** Create a new page (e.g., `/thank-you`) that the user should see after submitting.
2. **Insert script on Thank You Page:**
 *   Open the settings of the Thank You Page (gear icon).
 *   Go to **Advanced**.
 *   Paste the following code there:

 ```html
 <script>
   window.addEventListener('load', function() {
     if(window.bchic) {
       bchic('track', 'form_submit');
     }
   });
 </script>
    ```

3. **Redirect Form:**
 *   Edit your contact form on the website.
 *   Go to **Post-Submit** in the form settings.
 *   Select **Redirect** and enter the link to your Thank You Page (e.g., `/thank-you`).

## Track Bookings (Squarespace Scheduling / Acuity)

Since the booking system (formerly Acuity) often runs in an iFrame or separately, tracking must be set up there separately.

1. Go to **Scheduling** in the main menu.
2. Select **Integrations** in the bar on the left.
3. Click on **Analytics & Conversion Tracking**.
4. Paste the following snippet in the **HTML Tracking Code** field.

<Warning>
    **Important:** Since this is an isolated area, the main script must be loaded *again* here. Replace `YOUR-ID-HERE` with your real ID.
</Warning>

 ```html
 <!-- 1. Load bchic -->
 <script defer src="https://analytics.bchic.de/script.js" data-website-id="YOUR-ID-HERE"></script>

 <!-- 2. Fire event -->
 <script>
   window.addEventListener('load', function() {
     // %price% is a placeholder variable from Squarespace Scheduling
     var priceInCents = %price% * 100;

     if(window.bchic) {
       bchic('track', 'booking_confirmed', {
         value: priceInCents
       });
     }
   });
 </script>
    ```

5. Click on **Save Settings**.
