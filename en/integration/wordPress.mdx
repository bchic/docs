Integration into WordPress is straightforward. We recommend using a simple Code Snippet plugin so that tracking remains intact even if you change or update your theme.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Copy Tracking Script">
        First, get your script from the dashboard.

        Go to the **Settings** of your website in the bchic Dashboard and copy the HTML code. It looks something like this:

        ```html
        <script defer src="https://analytics.bchic.de/script.js" data-website-id="YOUR-ID-HERE"></script>
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Install Plugin">
        To safely insert the code, use the free plugin **WPCode** (formerly "Insert Headers and Footers").

        1. Log in to your WordPress Admin Panel.
        2. Go to **Plugins > Add New**.
        3. Search for `WPCode`.
        4. Install and activate the plugin by "WPCode".
    </Step>

    <Step title="Insert Script">
        After activation, you will find the item **Code Snippets** in the menu on the left.

        1. Go to **Code Snippets > Header & Footer**.
        2. Paste your bchic script into the first field **Header**.
        3. Click **Save Changes** in the top right.

        <img src="/images/integration/wordpress/header-footer.jpeg" alt="WPCode Header Area" />

        That's it! Clear your cache if necessary, and bchic will track all visitors from now on.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Important Note on Caching Plugins

WordPress sites often use aggressive caching or optimization plugins (like WP Rocket, Autoptimize, SiteGround Optimizer).

These plugins often try to combine JavaScript files (minify/combine). This can cause our script to stop working correctly.

**The Solution:**
Make sure our script is excluded from "Minification" or "Combination". Look for a setting like "Exclude External Scripts" or "Ignored URLs" in your caching plugin and add the following domain:

`analytics.bchic.de/script.js`

## Advanced: Track Authors (Custom Events)

Do you want to know which authors are read the most on your blog? You can solve this via a **Custom Event** in your `functions.php`.

Paste the following code into the `functions.php` of your child theme or into a Code Snippet plugin (as a PHP snippet):

```php
function add_bchic_author_tracking() {
    // Execute code only on single posts
    if (is_single()) {
        $author_nickname = get_the_author_meta('nickname');
        ?>
        <script>
            window.addEventListener('load', function() {
                if(window.bchic) {
                    // Sends an event "author_view" with the author's name as payload
                    bchic.track('author_view', {
                        author: '<?php echo esc_js($author_nickname); ?>'
                    });
                }
            });
        </script>
        <?php
    }
}
add_action('wp_footer', 'add_bchic_author_tracking');
```
