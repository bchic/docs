Integration into Webflow is done via the global project settings. You need a Webflow plan that supports **Custom Code** (Site Plan or Workspace Plan).

<Steps>
    <Step title="Copy Tracking Script">
        Copy your tracking script from the bchic Dashboard (Settings -> Website).

        The code looks something like this:

        ```html
        <script defer src="https://analytics.bchic.de/script.js" data-website-id="YOUR-ID-HERE"></script>
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Open Project Settings">
        1. Open your Webflow Dashboard.
        2. Click on the **three dots (...)** next to your project and select **Settings**.
        3. Navigate to the **Custom Code** tab in the top tab bar.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Paste Code">
        Paste your bchic script into the **Head Code** field.

        <Warning>
            Make sure **not** to put the code in the Footer Code so that tracking starts as early as possible.
        </Warning>

        Then click the green **Save Changes** button.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Publish">
        Custom Code in Webflow only becomes active once the site has been published.

        Click **Publish** in the top right and select your domains. Once the publish process is complete, bchic is active.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Custom Events in Webflow (Track Buttons)

In Webflow, you can easily track interactions (like clicks on important buttons) without making the button itself "dirty". We use **IDs** for this.

1. Select your button in the **Webflow Designer**.
2. Go to the **Settings (gear icon)** on the right.
3. Give the button a unique name in the **ID** field, e.g., `cta-button-header`.

Now go back to the **Page Settings** (or global Custom Code) in the **Before &lt;/body&gt; tag** area and insert this snippet:

```html
<script>
  var btn = document.getElementById('cta-button-header');

  if (btn) {
    btn.addEventListener('click', function() {
      if(window.bchic) {
        bchic.track('signup_click', { position: 'header' });
      }
    });
  }
</script>
```
