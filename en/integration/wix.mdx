Integration into Wix is done via the Dashboard in the "Custom Code" area.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Copy Tracking Script">
        Copy your tracking script from the bchic settings.

        ```html
        <script defer src="https://analytics.bchic.de/script.js" data-website-id="YOUR-ID-HERE"></script>
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Open Settings">
        Go to your Wix Dashboard (not the editor, but the management area).

        1. Click **Settings** in the bottom left.
        2. Scroll down in the "Advanced" section (at the very bottom) to **Custom Code**.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add Code">
        1. Click **+ Add Custom Code** in the top right.
        2. Paste your bchic script into the **Paste code snippet here** text box.
        3. Give the entry a name, e.g., `bchic Analytics`.
        4. Under **Add Code to Pages**:
        - Select **All pages**.
        - Important: Select **Load code once** in the dropdown, as bchic automatically detects page changes.
        5. Under **Place Code in**: **Head**.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Save & Publish">
        Click **Apply**. The code is active immediately.

        Visit your live site (not the preview in the editor) to check if the first page view arrives in the dashboard.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Custom Events in Wix (Velo)

In Wix, it is difficult to target HTML elements directly by ID because Wix generates IDs dynamically. The easiest way for conversion tracking (e.g., contact form) is to use a **Thank You Page**.

### Method: Thank You Page (Recommended)

1. Create a new page in Wix (e.g., "Thank You").
2. Set your contact form to redirect to this page after submission.
3. Go back to **Settings > Custom Code**.
4. Add a **new** code snippet:

```html
<script>
  // Waits until bchic is loaded
  window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    if (window.bchic) {
      bchic.track( 'form_submit');
    }
  });
</script>
```

5. Under **Add Code to Pages**, select **Choose specific pages** this time and check **only** your Thank You page.
6. Placement: **Body - end**.

Every time someone lands on the Thank You page, the `form_submit` event is counted.
